## Attendees:
    * Stack

    * Nick Eggleston
    * David H
    * Jeremy Siadal
    * Al Bowles
    * Chris Simmons
    * Sherif

## Discussions:
     Chris: Are we willing to support all openHPC stack or just the modules and how we imagine achieving this?
     Jeremy: Clear a bit of distro related stuff from openHPC would be great such as automake / autoconf
     Stack: We need to have a base line so people can start use rocky on HPC and make Rocky accessible
     Chris: A Demo / technical talk in 4 weeks
     Chris: Are we going to focus on 8 and 9?
     Stack and Chris, would be great if we can focus on 9
     Sherif: I hope we can do both but with 9 in the spotlight "this needs to be a SIG decision"
     Stack: Question, if we start moving openHPC within HPC sig are they going support more distros, we don't want to break packages for other EL distros
     Chris: so far testing on Rocky as the only supported EL distro

## Action items:
    * Get a demo / technical talk after 4 weeks "Sherif can arrange that with Chris"
    * Getting a list of packages that openHPC would like to move to distros "Jeremy will be point of contact if we need those in couple of weeks"
